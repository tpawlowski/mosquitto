Add a very brief blurb on packages needed for compilin
The following packages are required for mosquitto:

sqlite3 (required, package name libsqlite3-dev or similar)
tcp-wrappers (optional, package name libwrap0-dev)
sqlite3-pcre (required for wildcard topic matching, not normally packaged)

sqlite3-pcre is a sqlite3 extension that can be found at
http://git.altlinux.org/people/at/packages/?p=sqlite3-pcre.git

To compile, run "make".

Both tcp-wrappers support and wildcard topic matching support can be removed
by editing config.h to comment out the appropriate #define lines.

If you have any questions, problems or suggestions (particularly related to
installing on a more unusual device like a plug-computer) then please get in
touch using the details in readme.txt.

class Mosquitto:
	"""MQTT version 3.1 client class.
	
	This is the main class for use communicating with an MQTT broker.

	General usage flow:

	* Use connect() to connect to a broker
	* Call loop() frequently to maintain network traffic flow with the broker
	* Use subscribe() to subscribe to a topic and receive messages
	* Use publish() to send messages
	* Use disconnect() to disconnect from the broker

	Data returned from the broker is made available with the use of callback
	functions as described below.

	Callbacks
	=========

	A number of callback functions are available to receive data back from the
	broker. To use a callback, define a function and then assign it to the
	client. The callback function may be a class member if desired. All of the
	callbacks as described below have an "obj" argument. This variable
	corresponds directly to the obj argument passed when creating the client
	instance. It is however optional when defining the callback functions, so
	the on connect callback function can be defined as on_connect(obj, rc) or
	on_connect(rc) for example.

	The callbacks:

	on_connect(obj, rc): called when the broker responds to our connection
	  request. The value of rc determines success or not:
	  0: Connection successful
	  1: Connection refused - incorrect protocol version
	  2: Connection refused - invalid client identifier
	  3: Connection refused - server unavailable
	  4: Connection refused - bad username or password
	  5: Connection refused - not authorised
	  6-255: Currently unused.

	on_disconnect(obj): called when the client disconnects from the broker, but
	  only after having sent a disconnection message to the broker. This will
	  not be called if the client is disconnected unexpectedly.

	on_message(obj, message): called when a message has been received on a
	  topic that the client subscribes to. The message variable is a
	  MosquittoMessage that describs all of the message parameters.

	on_publish(obj, mid): called when a message that was to be sent using the
	  publish() call has completed transmission to the broker. For messages
	  with QoS levels 1 and 2, this means that the appropriate handshakes have
	  completed. For QoS 0, this simply means that the message has left the
	  client. The mid variable matches the mid variable returned from the
	  corresponding publish() call, to allow outgoing messages to be tracked.
	  This callback is important because even if the publish() call returns
	  success, it does not means that the message has been sent.

	on_subscribe(obj, mid, granted_qos): called when the broker responds to a
	  subscribe request. The mid variable matches the mid variable returned
	  from the corresponding subscribe() call. The granted_qos variable is a
	  list of integers that give the QoS level the broker has granted for each
	  of the different subscription requests.

	on_unsubscribe(obj, mid): called when the broker responds to an unsubscribe
	  request. The mid variable matches the mid variable returned from the
	  corresponding unsubscribe() call.

	Example:

	def on_connect(rc):
		if rc == 0:
			print "Connected ok"
	
	client = mosquitto.Mosquitto("id")
	client.on_connect = on_connect
	...

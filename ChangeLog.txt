0.5 - 2010xxxx
==============

- No longer store QoS=0 messages for disconnected clients that do not have
  clean start set.
- Rename msg_timeout option to retry_interval for better rsmb compatibility.
- Change persistence behaviour. The database is now stored in memory even if
  persistence is enabled. It is written to disk when mosquitto exits and also at
  periodic intervals as defined by the new autosave_interval option.
- The writing of the persistence database may be forced by sending mosquitto
  the SIGUSR1 signal.
- Clients that do not send CONNECT as their first command are now
  disconnected.
- Boolean configuration values may now be specified with true/false as well as
  1/0.
- Log message on CONNECT with invalid protocol or protocol version.
- Default sqlite3-pcre path on Linux is now /usr/lib/sqlite3/pcre.so to match
  future sqlite3-pcre packages.

0.4.2 - 20100203
================

- Fix segfault on client connect with invalid protocol name/version.

0.4.1 - 20100112
===============

- Fix regex used for finding retained messages to send on new subscription.

0.4 - 20100105
==============

- Added support for wildcard subscriptions using + and #.
- All network operations are now non-blocking and can cope with partial
  packets, meaning that networking should be a lot more reliable.
- Total messsages/bytes sent/received are now available in $SYS.
- Improved logging information - use client ip address and id instead of
  socket number.
- Broker build timestamp is available in $SYS.
- Keepalive==0 is now correctly treated as "never disconnect".
- Fixed manpage installation.
- Fixed incorrect $SYS hierarchy locations in documentation and code.
- Debug type log messages are no longer sent to "topics".
- Default logging destination no longer includes "topics" to prevent possible
  error logging to the db before it is initialised.
- Periodic $SYS messages can now be disabled.
- stdout and stderr are flushed when logging to them to give more timely
  updates.
- dup is now set correctly when resending messages.
- Database format bumped due to topic column naming fix.

0.3 - 20091217
==============

- The port option in the configuration file and --port command line argument
  may now be given any number of times to make mosquitto listen on multiple
  sockets.
- Add new config file and command line option "interface" to specify an
  interface to listen on, rather than all interfaces.
- Added host access control through tcp-wrappers support.
- Set SO_REUSEADDR on the listening socket so restart is much quicker.
- Added support for tracking current heap memory usage - this is published on
  the topic "$SYS/broker/heap/current size"
- Added code for logging to stderr, stdout, syslog and topics. 
- Added logging to numerous places - still plenty of scope for more.

0.2 - 20091204
==============

- Replaced the command line option --foreground with --daemon, swapping the
  default behaviour.
- Added the command line option --config-file, to specify a config file to
  load.  If this is not given, no config file is load and the default options
  are used.
- Added the command line option --port for specifying the port to listen on.
  This overrides values in the config file.
- Don't use persistence by default.
- Default behaviour is now more sane when run by a normal user with no command
  line options (combination of above changes).
- Added option user to config file, defaulting to a value of mosquitto. If
  this value isn't blank and mosquitto is started by root, then it will drop
  privileges by changing to the user and its primary group. This replaces the
  current behaviour of refusing to start if run by root.
- Fix non-persistent mode, which would never work in the previous release.
- Added information on default values of msg_timeout and sys_interval to the
  mosquitto.conf man page. (closes bug #492045).

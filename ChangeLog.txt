0.11 - 2011xxxx
===============

- Removed all old sqlite code.

0.10 - 20110429
===============

- Implement support for the password_file option and accompanying
  authentication requirements in the broker.
- Implement topic Access Control Lists. 
- mosquitto_will_set() and mosquitto_publish() now return
  MOSQ_ERR_PAYLOAD_SIZE if the payload is too large (>268,435,455 bytes).
- Bridge support can now be disabled at compile time.
- Group together network writes for outgoing packets - don't send single byte
  writes!
- Add support for clientid_prefixes variable.
- Add support for the clientid config variable for controlling bridge client
  ids.
- Remove 32-bit database ID support because htobe64() no longer used.
- Multiple client subscriptions to the same topic result in only a single
  subscription. Bug #744077.

0.9.3 - 20110310
================

- Set retained message status for QoS 2 messages (bug #726535).
- Only abort with an error when opening listening sockets if no address family
  is available, rather than aborting when any address family is not available.
- Don't clean queued messages when a non clean session client reconnects.
- Make mosquitto.py compatible with Python <2.6.
- Fix mosquitto.h header includes for Windows.

0.9.2 - 20110208
================

- Only send a single DISCONNECT command when using -l in the pub client.
- Set QoS=1 on PUBREL commands to meet protocol spec.
- Don't leak sockets on connection failure in the library.
- Install man pages when building under cmake.
- Fix crash bug on malformed CONNECT message.
- Clients are now rejected if their socket peer name cannot be obtained on
  connection.
- Fix a number of potential problems caused when a client with a duplicate id
  connects.
- Install mosquitto.conf under cmake.

0.9.1 - 20101203
================

- Add missing code for parsing the "bind_address" configuration option.
- Fix missing include when compiling with tcp-wrappers support.
- Add linker version script for C library to control exported functions.

0.9 - 20101114
==============

- Client and message data is now stored in memory with custom routines rather
  than a sqlite database. This removes the dependencies on sqlite, pcre and
  sqlite3-pcre. It also means that the persistent database format has had to
  be reimplemented in a custom format. Optional support for importing old
  sqlite databases is provided.
- Added IPv6 support for mosquitto and the clients.
- Provide username and password support for the clients and client libraries.
  This is part of the new MQTT v3.1 spec.
- The broker supports the username and password connection flags, but will not
  do anything with the username and password.
- Python callback functions now optionally take an extra argument which will
  return the user object passed to the Mosquitto() constructor, or the calling
  python object itself if nothing was given to Mosquitto().
- Remove the mosquitto command line option "-i interface".
- Remove the mosquitto.conf "interface" variable.
- Add support for the listener config variable (replaces the interface
  variable)
- Add support for the bind_address config variable.
- Change the port config variable behaviour to match that of rsmb (applies to
  the default listener only, can be given just once).
- Fix QoS 2 protocol compliance - stop sending duplicate messages and handle
  timeouts correctly. Fixes bug #598290.
- Set retain flag correctly for outgoing messages. It should only be set for
  messages sent in response to a subscribe command (ie. stale data).
- Fix bug in returning correct CONNACK result to on_connect client callback.
- Don't send client will if it is disconnected for exceeding its keepalive
  timer.
- Fix client library unsubscribe function incorrectly sending a SUBSCRIBE
  command when it should be UNSUBSCRIBE. 
- Fix max_inflight_messages and max_queued_messages operation. These
  parameters now apply only to QoS 1 and 2 messages and are used regardless of
  the client connection state.
- mosquitto.conf now installed to /etc/mosquitto/mosquitto.conf instead of
  /etc/mosquitto.conf. The /etc/mosquitto/ directory will be used for password
  and access control files in the future.
- Give the compile time option of using 32-bit integers for the database IDs
  instead of 64-bit integers. This is useful where htobe64()/be64toh() are not
  available or for embedded systems for example.
- The DUP bit is now set correctly when resending PUBREL messages.
- A port to Windows native has been partially completed. This currently drops a
  number of features, including the ability to change configuration parameters
  and persistent storage.

0.8.3 - 20101004
================

- Fix QoS 2 protocol compliance - stop sending duplicate messages and handle
  timeouts correctly. Fixes bug #598290. (backported from future 0.9 code)

0.8.2 - 20100815
================

- Fix default loop() timeout value in mosquitto.py. Previous value was 0,
  causing high cpu load.
- Fix message handling problem in client library when more than one message was
  in the client queue.
- Fix the logic used to determine whether a QoS>0 message needs to be retried.
- Fix the Python sub.py example so that it quits on error.

0.8.1 - 20100812
================

- Improve python interface
- Fix incorrect return value from message delete function
- Use logging function to print error messages in clients.
- Fix python installation script DESTDIR.
- Fix library destination path for 64-bit machines.

0.8 - 20100807
==============

- Topics starting with a / are treated as distinct to those not starting with
  a /. For example, /topic/path is different to topic/path. This matches the
  behaviour of rsmb.
- Correctly calculate the will QoS on a new client connection (bug #597451).
- Add "addresses" configuration file variable as an alias of "address", for
  better rsmb compatibility.
- Bridge clean_session setting is now false, to give more sensible behaviour
  and be more compatible with rsmb.
- Add cleansession variable for configuring bridges.
- Add keepalive_interval variable for bridges.
- Remove default topic subscription for mosquitto_sub because the old
  behaviour was too confusing.
- Added a C client library, which the pub and sub clients now use.
- Added a C++ client library (bound to the C library).
- Added a Python client library (bound to the C library).
- Added CMake build scripts to allow the library and clients (not the broker)
  to be compiled natively on Windows.

0.7 - 20100615
==============

- mosquitto_pub can now send null (zero length) messages.
- Don't store QoS=0 messages for disconnected clients with subscriptions of
  QoS>0.
- accept() all available sockets when new clients are connecting, rather than
  just one.
- Add option to print debug messages in pub and sub clients.
- hg revision is now exported via $SYS/broker/changeset
- Send Will when client exceeds keepalive timer and is disconnected.
- Check to see if a client has a will before sending it.
- Correctly deal with clients connecting with the same id multiple times.
- Add compile time option to disable heap memory tracking.
- Use poll() instead of select() to allow >1024 clients.
- Implement max_connections.
- Run VACUUM on in-memory database on receiving SIGUSR2.
- Fix bridge keepalive timeouts and reconnects.
- Don't attempt to drop root privileges when running on Windows as this isn't
  well supported (bug #586231).

0.6.1 - 20100506
================

- Fix DB auto upgrade for messages table.

0.6 - 20100505
==============

- Basic support for connecting multiple MQTT brokers together (bridging).
- mosquitto_sub can now subscribe to multiple topics (limited to a global QoS).
- mosquitto_pub can now send a file as a message.
- mosquitto_pub can now read all of stdin and send it as a message.
- mosquitto_pub can now read stdin and send each line as a message.
- mosquitto will now correctly run VACUUM on the persistent database on exit.
- Implement a more efficient database design, so that only one copy of each
  message is held in the database, rather than one per subscribed client.
- Add the store_cleanup_interval config option for dealing with the internal
  message store.
- Add support for disabling "clean session" for the sub client.
- Add support for automatic upgrading of the mosquitto DB from v1 to v2.
- Add persistence_file config option to allow changing the filename of the
  persistence database. This allows multiple mosquitto DBs to be stored in the
  same location whilst keeping persistence_location compatible with rsmb.
- Don't store QoS=0 messages for disconnected clients. Fixes bug #572608. This
  wasn't correctly fixed in version 0.5.
- Don't disconnect clients if they send a PUBLISH with zero length payload
  (bug #573610).
- If a retained message is received with a zero length payload, the retained
  message for that topic is deleted.
- Send through zero length messages.
- Produce a warning on unsupported rsmb options instead of quitting.
- Describe clean session flag in the mqtt man page.
- Implement the max_inflight_messages and max_queued_messages features in the
  broker.

0.5.4 - 20100311
================

- Fix memory allocation in mqtt3_fix_sub_topic() (bug #531861).
- Remove accidental limit of 100 client connections.
- Fix mosquitto_pub handling of messages with QoS>0 (bug #537061).

0.5.3 - 20100303
================

- Will messages are now only sent when a client disconnects unexpectedly.
- Fix all incoming topics/subscriptions that start with a / or contain
  multiple / in a row (//).
- Do actually disconnect client when it sends an empty subscription/topic string.
- Add missing $SYS/broker/clients/total to man page.

0.5.2 - 20100302
================

- Always update last backup time, so that the backup doesn't run every time
  through the main loop once autosave_interval has been reached.
- Report $SYS/broker/uptime in the same format as rsmb.
- Make mandatory options obvious in usage output and man page of mosquitto_pub.
  Fixes bug #529990.
- Treat subscriptions with a trailing slash correctly. This should fix bugs
  #530369 and #530099.
  
0.5.1 - 20100227
================

- Must daemonise before pid file is written.

0.5 - 20100227
==============

- No longer store QoS=0 messages for disconnected clients that do not have
  clean start set.
- Rename msg_timeout option to retry_interval for better rsmb compatibility.
- Change persistence behaviour. The database is now stored in memory even if
  persistence is enabled. It is written to disk when mosquitto exits and also at
  periodic intervals as defined by the new autosave_interval option.
- The writing of the persistence database may be forced by sending mosquitto
  the SIGUSR1 signal.
- Clients that do not send CONNECT as their first command are now
  disconnected.
- Boolean configuration values may now be specified with true/false as well as
  1/0.
- Log message on CONNECT with invalid protocol or protocol version.
- Default sqlite3-pcre path on Linux is now /usr/lib/sqlite3/pcre.so to match
  future sqlite3-pcre packages.
- Add mosquitto_sub and mosquitto_pub, simple clients for subscribe/publish.
- Add man pages for clients.
- Add general man page on mqtt.
- Root privileges are now dropped only after attempting to write a pid file
  (if configured). This means that the pid file can be written to /var/run/
  directly and should fix bug #523183.

0.4.2 - 20100203
================

- Fix segfault on client connect with invalid protocol name/version.

0.4.1 - 20100112
===============

- Fix regex used for finding retained messages to send on new subscription.

0.4 - 20100105
==============

- Added support for wildcard subscriptions using + and #.
- All network operations are now non-blocking and can cope with partial
  packets, meaning that networking should be a lot more reliable.
- Total messsages/bytes sent/received are now available in $SYS.
- Improved logging information - use client ip address and id instead of
  socket number.
- Broker build timestamp is available in $SYS.
- Keepalive==0 is now correctly treated as "never disconnect".
- Fixed manpage installation.
- Fixed incorrect $SYS hierarchy locations in documentation and code.
- Debug type log messages are no longer sent to "topics".
- Default logging destination no longer includes "topics" to prevent possible
  error logging to the db before it is initialised.
- Periodic $SYS messages can now be disabled.
- stdout and stderr are flushed when logging to them to give more timely
  updates.
- dup is now set correctly when resending messages.
- Database format bumped due to topic column naming fix.

0.3 - 20091217
==============

- The port option in the configuration file and --port command line argument
  may now be given any number of times to make mosquitto listen on multiple
  sockets.
- Add new config file and command line option "interface" to specify an
  interface to listen on, rather than all interfaces.
- Added host access control through tcp-wrappers support.
- Set SO_REUSEADDR on the listening socket so restart is much quicker.
- Added support for tracking current heap memory usage - this is published on
  the topic "$SYS/broker/heap/current size"
- Added code for logging to stderr, stdout, syslog and topics. 
- Added logging to numerous places - still plenty of scope for more.

0.2 - 20091204
==============

- Replaced the command line option --foreground with --daemon, swapping the
  default behaviour.
- Added the command line option --config-file, to specify a config file to
  load.  If this is not given, no config file is load and the default options
  are used.
- Added the command line option --port for specifying the port to listen on.
  This overrides values in the config file.
- Don't use persistence by default.
- Default behaviour is now more sane when run by a normal user with no command
  line options (combination of above changes).
- Added option user to config file, defaulting to a value of mosquitto. If
  this value isn't blank and mosquitto is started by root, then it will drop
  privileges by changing to the user and its primary group. This replaces the
  current behaviour of refusing to start if run by root.
- Fix non-persistent mode, which would never work in the previous release.
- Added information on default values of msg_timeout and sys_interval to the
  mosquitto.conf man page. (closes bug #492045).

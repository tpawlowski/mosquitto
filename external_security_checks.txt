Mosquitto is now easier to integrate with existing username/password
databases. It doesn't do any of this for you, but it does provide access
points to help.

If you wish to do this, uncomment the WITH_EXTERNAL_SECURITY_CHECKS line in
config.h, or enable the option when configuring the build options with cmake.

You should now edit src/security_external.c to fit your system. If you need to
link extra libraries, add them to src/Makefile or src/CMakeLists.txt.

All functions below have access to the additional config variables db_host,
db_port, db_name, db_username and db_password. They can be accessed via
db->config->db_*.

The functions you need to implement are:


int mosquitto_unpwd_init(struct _mosquitto_db *db)

* Called at mosquitto startup. This is used to open database connections/files
* or anything else that needs to be done once and is related to username and
* password checks.
* Should return MOSQ_ERR_SUCCESS on success, or anything else on error. See
* lib/mosquitto.h for currently defined errors, or use MOSQ_ERR_UNKNOWN.


int mosquitto_unpwd_cleanup(struct _mosquitto_db *db)

* Called when the broker is shutting down. This is used to close database
* connections/files or anything else that needs to be done onc and is related
* to username and password checks.
* Should return MOSQ_ERR_SUCCESS on success, or anything else on error. See
* lib/mosquitto.h for currently defined errors, or use MOSQ_ERR_UNKNOWN.


int mosquitto_unpwd_check(struct _mosquitto_db *db, const char *username, const char *password)

* Called each time a username and/or password needs to be checked.
* Should return MOSQ_ERR_SUCCESS on success, MOSQ_ERR_AUTH for authentication
* errors (username/password invalid) or anything else for other errors. See
* lib/mosquitto.h for currently defined errors, or use MOSQ_ERR_UNKNOWN.


int mosquitto_acl_init(struct _mosquitto_db *db)

* Called at mosquitto startup. This is used to open database connections/files
* or anything else that needs to be done once and is related to access control
* list checks.
* Should return MOSQ_ERR_SUCCESS on success, or anything else on error. See
* lib/mosquitto.h for currently defined errors, or use MOSQ_ERR_UNKNOWN.


void mosquitto_acl_cleanup(struct _mosquitto_db *db)

* Called when the broker is shutting down. This is used to close database
* connections/files or anything else that needs to be done onc and is related
* to username and password checks.
* Should return MOSQ_ERR_SUCCESS on success, or anything else on error. See
* lib/mosquitto.h for currently defined errors, or use MOSQ_ERR_UNKNOWN.


int mosquitto_acl_check(struct _mosquitto_db *db, mqtt3_context *context, const char *topic, int access)

* Called each time a topic access control list should be checked.
* Should return MOSQ_ERR_SUCCESS on success, MOSQ_ERR_ACL_DENIED for ACL
* denials or anything else for other errors. See lib/mosquitto.h for currently
* defined errors, or use MOSQ_ERR_UNKNOWN.

# Config file for mosquitto
#
# See mosquitto.conf(5) for more information.
#
# This isn't a stable file format.
# Ultimately it should probably mirror the format used by rsmb.
#
# Default values are shown, uncomment to change.

# Network interface to bind to, e.g. eth0
# Optionally specify a port number if not using the default 1883.
# For example "interface eth0:1834"
#interface

# Port to bind to.
# This option may be repeated to make mosquitto listen on multiple ports.
#port 1883

# Time in seconds to wait before resending an outgoing QoS=1 or QoS=2 message.
#retry_interval 20

# Time in seconds between updates of the $SYS tree.
#sys_interval 10

# Time in seconds between cleaning the internal message store of unreferenced
# messages. Lower values will result in lower memory usage but more processor
# time, higher values will have the opposite effect.
# Setting a value of 0 means the unreferenced messages will be disposed of as
# quickly as possible.
#store_clean_interval 10

# Write process id to a file. Default is a blank string which means a pid file
# shouldn't be written.
# This should be set to /var/run/mosquitto.pid if mosquitto is being run
# automatically on boot with an init script and start-stop-daemon or similar.
#pid_file

# When run as root, drop privileges to this user and its primary group.
# Leave blank to stay as root, but this is not recommended.
# If run as a non-root user, this setting has no effect.
# Note that on Windows this has no effect and so mosquitto should be started by
# the user you wish it to run as.
#user mosquitto

# The maximum number of messages currently inflight per client. This includes
# messages that are partway through the handshakes for QoS>0 messages and those
# that are being retried. Defaults to 10. Set to 0 for no maximum.
#max_inflight_messages 10

# The maximum number of messages to hold in a queue for a client that is
# disconnected. Defaults to 100. Set to 0 for no maximum.
#max_queued_messages 100

# The maximum number of client connections to allow. This is currently a global
# setting, regardless of the number of ports that mosquitto is listening on.
# Default is -1, which means unlimited connections.
# Note that other process limits mean that unlimited connections are not really
# possible. Typically the default maximum number of connections possible is
# around 1024.
#max_connections -1

# ======================================================================
# Persistence
# ======================================================================

# If persistence is enabled, save the in-memory database to disk every 
# autosave_interval seconds. If set to 0, the persistence database will 
# only be written when mosquitto exists.
# Note that writing of the persistence database can be forced by sending
# mosquitto a SIGUSR1 signal.
#autosave_interval 1800

# Save persistent message data to disk (1/0).
# This saves information about all messages, including subscriptions,
# currently in-flight messages and retained messages.
#persistence 0

# The filename to use for the persistent database, not including the path.
#persistence_file mosquitto.db

# Location for persistent database. Must include trailing /
# Default is an empty string (current directory).
# Set to /var/lib/mosquitto/ if running as a proper service.
#persistence_location

# ======================================================================
# Logging
# ======================================================================

# Places to log to. Use multiple log_dest lines for multiple logging
# destinations.
# Possible destinations are: stdout stderr syslog topic
# stdout and stderr log to the console on the named output.
# syslog uses the userspace syslog facility which usually ends up in
# /var/log/messages or similar.
# topic logs to the broker topic '$SYS/broker/log/<severity>', where severity
# is one of D, E, W, N, I which are debug, error, warning, notice and
# information.
# Use "log_dest none" if you wish to disable logging.
#log_dest stderr

# Types of messages to log. Use multiple log_type lines for logging
# multiple types of messages.
# Possible types are: debug, error, warning, notice, information, none.
# Note that debug type messages are for decoding the incoming network packets.
# They are not logged in syslog.
#log_type error
#log_type warning
#log_type notice
#log_type information

# ======================================================================
# Bridges
# ======================================================================

# Experimental support for connecting multiple MQTT brokers together.
# Specify multiple sets of connection, address and topic configurations.
# Each connection must have a unique name.
# Only a single address per configuration is currently supported, unlike in
# rsmb.
# The direction that the topic will be shared can be chosen by specifying out,
# in or both, where the default value is out. 
# Multiple topics can be specified per connection, but be careful not to create
# any loops.
#connection <name>
#address <host>[:<port>]
#topic <topic> [out | in | both]

# Set the clean session variable for this bridge.
# When set to true, when the bridge disconnects for any reason, all messages
# and subscriptions will be cleaned up on the remote broker. Note that with
# cleansession set to true, there may be a significant amount of retained
# messages sent when the bridge reconnects after losing its connection.
# When set to false, the subscriptions and messages are kept on the remote
# broker, and delivered when the bridge reconnects.
#cleansession false

# Set the keepalive interval for this bridge connection, in seconds.
#keepalive_interval 60

# ======================================================================
# Extensions
# ======================================================================

# Path to sqlite regex extension. Note that mosquitto will fail to start if
# this cannot be loaded.
# Default on Windows/Cygwin:
#ext_sqlite_regex ./sqlite3-pcre.dll
# Default on other platforms:
#ext_sqlite_regex /usr/lib/sqlite3/pcre.so
